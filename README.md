# Forecasting-Using-Fama-French-Model-Factors
This project involves forecasting the price direction of public US companies' market index (VTI) using the Fama-French Five-Factor Model. The dataset includes VTI's daily returns and various factors. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building forecasting models. Different model selection techniques like best subset, forward, and backward selection are used to determine the optimal predictors for the forecasting model. The project aims to predict VTI's next day's return and direction using historical data.

The Fama-French Five-Factor Model is a well-known asset pricing model that extends the original Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by incorporating additional factors that capture different dimensions of risk and return. These factors are:

**Market Risk (Mkt-RF):** This factor represents the excess return of the overall market compared to a risk-free rate.

**Size (SMB):** This factor captures the historical outperformance of small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks.

**Value (HML):** This factor reflects the outperformance of value stocks (those with high book-to-market ratios) over growth stocks (those with low book-to-market ratios).

**Profitability (RMW):** This factor represents the outperformance of stocks of companies with high profitability compared to those with low profitability.

**Investment (CMA):** This factor captures the outperformance of companies with low levels of investment.

The Fama-French Five-Factor Model suggests that these factors, in addition to the market risk factor, play a significant role in explaining the variations in stock returns. Researchers and analysts often use this model to assess the performance of portfolios and investment strategies and to better understand the sources of returns.
